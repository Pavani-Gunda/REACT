Folder structure in React:
It is used to organize the files and folders in a React project. The folder structure is as follows:

```
├── public  
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html  
│   ├── logo192.png
│   ├── logo512.png
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── robots.txt
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js  
│   ├── App.test.js 
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── logo.svg
│   ├── reportWebVitals.js
│   ├── setupTests.js
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── images  
│   │   └── icons
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── Header.js
│   │   ├── Footer.js
│   │   └── Sidebar.js
│   ├── pages
│   │   ├── Home.js
│   │   ├── About.js
│   │   └── Contact.js
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── api.js
│   │   └── auth.js
│   ├── styles
│   │   ├── main.css    
│   │   └── variables.css
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── helpers.js
│   │   └── constants.js


A clear structure helps in managing code, configuration, and assets effectively.

```
├── public
The public folder contains the static files that are served by the web server. It usually contains the index.html file, favicon.ico, and other static files. The public folder should not contain any JavaScript or CSS files, as they should be bundled by the build process.
```

```
CONCLUSION :
Project structure shows the organization of code and files, and a clean, simple, and decent project structure shows a clean written code, which helps to debug code, and another developer can easily read it. Also, while deploying code on the server, it can recognize files easily, which is why developers are implementing clean, simple, and decent project structures.
