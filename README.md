PORT: A port number is way to identify a specific process to communicate with on a server.
# Port Number
# Port numbers are used to identify specific processes or services on a server.
# They are used in conjunction with IP addresses to route network traffic to the correct destination.
# Port numbers are divided into three ranges:
# 1. Well-known ports (0-1023): These are reserved for specific services and protocols, such as HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
# 2. Registered ports (1024-49151): These are assigned to user processes or applications.
# 3. Dynamic or private ports (49152-65535): These are used for ephemeral or temporary connections.   
# Port numbers are used in TCP/IP networking to identify specific processes or services running on a server.
# They are used in conjunction with IP addresses to route network traffic to the correct destination.

some commonly used port numbers are:
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443
- FTP: 21
- SSH: 22
- SMTP: 25
- DNS: 53
- Telnet: 23
- POP3: 110
- IMAP: 143
- MySQL: 3306
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- Redis: 6379
- MongoDB: 27017
- Elasticsearch: 9200
- RabbitMQ: 5672

Port 80: 
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transferring web pages on the internet.
- Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic.
- When a user types a URL into their web browser, the browser sends a request to the server on port 80.
- The server then responds with the requested web page.
Port 443:
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP.
- It uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure the data being transmitted between the client and server.
- Port 443 is the default port for HTTPS traffic.
- When a user types a URL into their web browser with "https://" in front of it, the browser sends a request to the server on port 443.
Port 21:
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network.
- Port 21 is the default port for FTP traffic.
- When a user connects to an FTP server, the client sends a request to the server on port 21.
- The server then responds with a list of files and directories available for download or upload.
Port 22:
- SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage network devices and servers.
- Port 22 is the default port for SSH traffic.
port 25:
 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is commonly used for email.

Port 53:
- DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical naming system used to translate domain names into IP addresses.
- Port 53 is the default port for DNS traffic.
- When a user types a URL into their web browser, the browser sends a request to the DNS server on port 53.
- The DNS server then responds with the IP address of the requested domain name.
Port 23:
- Telnet is a network protocol used to provide a command-line interface for communication with a remote device or server.
- Port 23 is the default port for Telnet traffic.
- When a user connects to a Telnet server, the client sends a request to the server on port 23.
port 500:
- IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a protocol used to set up a security association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite.

port 443:
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP.

port 8080:
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transferring web pages on the internet.
- Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80 for HTTP traffic.
- It is often used for web servers that need to run on a different port than the default port 80.
